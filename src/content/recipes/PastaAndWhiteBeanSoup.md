A few notes, use a very large pot or halve the recipe if you don't have one.

Cannellini beans are also known as white kidney beans, so feel free to use them interchangibly.

You can reduce the cooking time on this  and it should still come out good.

Store the pasta separate from the soup if saving leftovers. Whole wheat pasta doens't rehead well in put back on the stove and the pasta will continue absorbing your soup.
