directions: [
  "In a large bowl, whisk together the finely diced sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and white balsamic vinegar with a pinch of salt.",
  
  "Add the extra-virgin olive oil and 2 tablespoons of oil from the sun-dried tomato jar. Whisk until well combined.",

  "Add the drained and rinsed white beans to the bowl. Season with salt.",

  "Cut the kernels from the corn cobs: line a large, wide bowl with a kitchen towel to catch the kernels. Holding the corn upright with one hand, use a chef’s knife to cut down the cob, removing two to three rows of kernels at a time.",

  "Add the corn kernels, diced zucchini, red onion, scallions, and diced jalapeño (if using) to the bowl. Toss everything to combine.",

  "Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt or vinegar as needed. If desired, add an extra tablespoon of vinegar and a pinch of salt.",

  "Add the fresh herbs, give it one final toss, and serve immediately. Alternatively, pack into storage containers and refrigerate for up to 1 week."

- Beans: Small white beans labeled as habichuelas blancas are ideal. They are smaller than Great Northern or Cannellini beans. Drain and rinse if using canned beans.
- Cheese Option: If desired, add 1/2 to 1 cup of small-diced Manchego or other cheese, though the salad is equally delicious without it.
