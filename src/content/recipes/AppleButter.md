## Tips
### Slow cooker
- Ceramic slow cookers should be used. Instant pot or other similar pressure cookers need lots of water to regulate the temperature. Because of this, you may find your apples don't cook well in the instant pot.
- Adjust high and low output based on your slow cooker. I have 2 6qt slow cookers and one of them, the low output is similar to the high output when uncovered.

### Desired thickness
- Experiment with this, you can really cook out a lot of water. Sugar is a preservative and the more water you cook out, the longer it will last in the fridge.
- Some apples have a lot of water in them, some don't at all. Depending on how old your apples are, and the variety, you may find cooking time varies drastically.

### Adaptations
- Apple cider vinegar can be added to make it a bit more acidic and tart. It will also dial down the sweetness.
- Added sugar is optional and really not needed if you get the right apples and cook it down a lot.
- Try with different types of apples. Some are sweeter, some are more tart.
- You can try this recipe with pears as well!
