directions: [
"Cook the quinoa according to package instructions. Once cooked, fluff it and set aside to cool.",
"For roasting the tomatoes (optional): Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Toss the tomatoes with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and season with a bit of salt and pepper. Roast for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are soft and slightly caramelized. Allow to cool completely.",
"Dice the red and yellow bell peppers, red onion, cucumbers, and chop the parsley.",
"Prepare the dressing by combining olive oil, lemon juice, white vinegar, salt, and pepper in a small dish. Stir well to combine.",
"In a large bowl, combine the cooled quinoa with the roasted tomatoes, diced vegetables, and chopped parsley. Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to combine.",
"If using avocado, add it just before serving to maintain freshness. Store the salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator if not serving immediately."

Notes:
- The choice of vegetables in this salad is flexible. Feel free to add any of your favorite veggies.
- For best results, add avocado right before serving. If not consuming the entire salad at once, store the avocado separately and add when ready to serve.
- This salad can be made a day ahead. If doing so, add the avocado and dressing on the day of serving.
- To add protein, consider including feta or crumbled goat cheese, shredded chicken, or hard-boiled eggs.
