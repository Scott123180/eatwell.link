directions: [
  "Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil (or water if skipping sautee), then add onion, garlic, carrots, mushrooms, and celery. (optional step, adds more depth)",

  "Saut√© for about 5 minutes until the vegetables are softened and slightly browned, stirring frequently.",

  "Add water, parsley and black peppercorns. Increase the heat to medium-high until the mixture comes to a boil.",

  "Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer. Stir to combine and loosely cover the pot with the lid slightly cracked.",

  "Simmer for at least 30 minutes, preferably 45 minutes to 1 hour (or up to 3 hours), for deeper flavor.",

  "Near the end of cooking, taste and adjust seasoning as needed.",

  "Once done, let the broth cool slightly before straining it into another pot to avoid burning yourself. Discard the solids and divide the broth between storage containers.",

  "Allow the broth to cool completely before sealing. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or deep freeze indefinitely"

- Lots of different things can be added to this broth to add flavor and depth. Adjust as desired!
- You can cook this for longer! Try simmering for a few hours and add water back as needed to build up flavor. You also don't have to worry about chopping the veggies smaller if simmering for longer as it'll cook thoroughly. 
- Leftover Veggie Scraps: Add in addition to or in place of other vegetables. They can be used straight from frozen.
- Herb Substitution: Substitute 1 tablespoon of dried thyme or rosemary per small handful of fresh herbs.
