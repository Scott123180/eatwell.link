directions: [
"Prepare the soup base by removing the heads and shells of the jumbo shrimp and deveining them. Boil water in a pot over medium-high heat, then add the shrimp heads and cook for 8 to 10 minutes to infuse the water with a sweet umami flavor. Remove the shrimp heads with a mesh strainer.",
"Add the peeled shrimp and chopped mushrooms to the pot. Cook for 2 minutes. Then add garlic, ginger, fish sauce, and brown sugar, cooking for an additional minute. Stir in the red curry paste until well dissolved, about 1 minute.",
"Pour in the coconut milk, stirring well to combine. Add lime juice and black pepper, continuing to stir.",
"Stir in the vermicelli rice noodles and cook until they are tender, about 3 minutes. Remove the pot from heat.",
"To assemble the soup, first scoop out the noodles into a medium-sized soup bowl using a noodle strainer. Add bean sprouts, baby bok choy, and chopped cilantro. Pour the curry soup base into the bowl, including the cooked shrimp and mushrooms.",
"Serve immediately, adding an additional tablespoon of lime juice if desired."

Notes:
- Be cautious not to overcook the noodles as they can break apart and disintegrate. Add them to the pot at the very end of the cooking process.
- For an extra burst of flavor, additional lime juice can be added upon serving.
