directions: [
  "Let pork loin sit at room temperature for 20 minutes",
  "Whisk together melted butter substitute, garlic, brown sugar, low sodium soy sauce, lemon zest, parsley, and thyme in a small bowl",
  "Season the pork with pepper and then brush the mixture around",
  "Turn the instant pot to saute and heat up the olive oil. When instant pot is to temperature, sear all sides until browned. 2-3 minutes each side. Tip: use an oil splatter shield to reduce splatter.Use tongs to pick up and move pork loin.",
  "Remove from instant pot and set aside",
  "Add the beer and deglaze the bottom (scrape up any bits and pieces that may have stuck)",
  "Cancel the saute and put the cooking trivet in. Put the pork on the trivet. Cook on high pressure for 15 minutes with 15 minute natural release. Then release any pressure.",
  "Use a meat thermometer to read the temperature. The thermometer should read at least 145. If it's off by a little, you can put the lid back on for 2 to 3 more minutes and the residual heat will cook it. If it's far away from the temp you may have to turn on pressure cooking for a few more minutes",
  "Transfer the pork loin to a cutting board, tent in foil. Let rest 15 minutes before cutting.",
  "While waiting, remove the trivet and enable saute and reduce the sauce by half, stirring occasionally",
  "The pan juices have a lot of flavor but also a lot of fat. Filter our the fat for a healthier sauce."
