Cooking Tips:
- Salt plays a crucial role in this recipe, especially in helping the potatoes cook properly in the acidic base of tomato sauce, balsamic vinegar, and soy sauce. Make sure to season the stew moderately to liberally with salt throughout the cooking process.
- Feel free to customize the stew with your favorite vegetables, like frozen peas, green beans, or canned chickpeas. Just keep the proportions similar for the best result.
- Experiment with flavors by adding spices like cumin, paprika, ground ginger, or cinnamon.
- For a spicy twist, incorporate red pepper flakes directly into the pot or sprinkle them over individual servings.
