directions: [
"Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and position the rack in the center.",
"Separate the leaves from the beets. Trim the beets and place them in a single layer on a large piece of foil. Wrap and seal the foil, then place it on a baking sheet. Roast in the oven until the beets are fork-tender, about 30 to 35 minutes. Once done, carefully open the foil and let the beets cool enough to handle.",
"In a medium bowl, mix the shallot with 1/4 cup of the rice vinegar and set aside for 10 minutes. On the same baking sheet, toss the torn rye bread with olive oil and spread it out in a single layer. Bake until toasted, about 5 to 6 minutes.",
"Tear the beet leaves into bite-sized pieces and add them to the bowl with the shallot, ideally aiming for about 6 cups. Toss to coat. Divide the greens among 4 plates.",
"Peel the cooled beets and cut each into quarters. Arrange the beets, eggs, croutons, and pickled shallots over the greens on each plate.",
"For the dressing, mix the sour cream, dill, chives, horseradish, and the remaining 1/4 cup vinegar. Season with black pepper. Drizzle the dressing over the salads and, if desired, sprinkle with additional dill and chopped chives.",
