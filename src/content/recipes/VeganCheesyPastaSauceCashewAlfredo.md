directions: 
  [
    "Begin by cooking your spaghetti as per the instructions on the package.",
    "In the meantime, combine cashew nuts, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, plant-based milk or water, lemon juice and zest, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a blender. Blend until the mixture achieves a smooth consistency. Add more liquid if the sauce appears too dense. It should be creamy yet not too thick.",
    "Taste and tweak the sauce according to your preference. It might taste a bit strong alone, but it will balance out when mixed with pasta.",
    "For the final half-minute of the pasta's cooking, introduce the spinach into the boiling water. Drain the pasta and spinach, then return them to the pan. Incorporate the halved tomatoes and the creamy sauce. Serve topped with fresh parsley and optional vegan parmesan."

A few notes: Remember to adjust the thickness of the sauce to your preference. You can also experiment with different types of plant-based milk for varied flavors. Store any leftover sauce separately for freshness.

Add fresh basil leaves to the sauce for an amazing fresh basil alfredo.
