Notes:
- Pasta: Choose your favorite type, such as campanelle, bow tie, cavatappi, fusilli, or penne.
- Lemon Juice: Opt for freshly squeezed lemon juice or 100% lemon juice from the produce section.
- Pine Nuts: These add protein and crunch. Walnuts or almonds are great alternatives.

Cooking Tips:
- Prepare noodles al dente to avoid a mushy salad and to make tossing easier.
- Shock the pasta by rinsing boiled noodles with cold water.
- Allow the pasta to cool before adding the dressing and other ingredients.
- Marinate the pasta salad in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours for the best flavor.
