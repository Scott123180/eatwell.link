Notes:
- Boiling your eggs is difficult, steam them instead! See the "hard cooked eggs" recipe on the website.
- With a 0.5 gallon mason jar, you can put 14 eggs in it it, no problem. Can fit more in it, you just have to reduce the amount of brine you use.
- Dill is optional if you just have pickling spices, that's fine
- For a variation, add cooked or canned sliced beets to the eggs. If using canned beets, substitute the water in the brine with beet juice.
- Adjust the sugar quantity in the brine according to your taste preference.
- The pickled eggs will keep for several weeks in the refrigerator.
