Tip for Cooking Lentils:

Rinse 1 cup of dry brown lentils. Place them in a medium saucepan with 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well and spread on a rimmed baking sheet. Refrigerate until cool, about 25 minutes.
